# 3. Next.js for Frontend Service
**Date:** 2025-04-25 \
**Status:** Accepted \
**Summary** \
*In the context of* delivering a web application with a modern and reactive interface,
*facing* functional requirements and a team familiar with React and TypeScript, *we decided* to 
build our frontend service with Next.js and React, *to achieve* a fast and efficient development 
process, a responsive and performant ui, and a scalable architecture, *accepting* the complexity 
of the framework. \
**Context** 
- We need to build a web application to interface with our user base.
- It needs to be modern, performant, responsive and reactive.

**Decision** \
We decided to go with Next.js and React for our frontend service. Our team is familiar with React,
and Next.js provides a deployable, full-stack framework for React. We gain the benefits of
server-side rendering, file-based routing, and inbuilt optimisations. \
**Consequences** \
This will mean members of our team need to learn a new framework and its quirks.
