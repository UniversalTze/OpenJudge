**Status:** Accepted \
**Summary** \
*In the context of* delivering a project with that requires storing persistent user data, 
a postgress db was proposed to the group. This service was used due to the simplicity in 
establishing a database with necessary schemas. PostgreSQL was also chosen because it is 
widely used across the industry and programming communities, is well-documented, and all 
team members are already familiar with it.

**Context** 
For this project, data that needs to be stored include: 
- User information and avatar (additive)
- List of problems available to the user and the metadata.
- List of problems attempted by specific user. 
- Session token ids (for security) and other security JWT tokens from our Auth service.
- User submissions. 
- List of problems completed by user. 

**Decision** \
We decided to implement use PostgreSQL for persisent storage for some of the things highlighted in the context. 
Given the teamâ€™s familiarity with PostgreSQL and the tightening exam deadlines, we decided it was the most optimal decision to proceed with the PostgreSQL.

**Consequences** \
The team miss out on an oppurtunity to potentially explore with non-relational databases and how they work with data. 
Additonal overhead for processing JSON items from the Problem, Test Runner and Front End service may be encountered.
