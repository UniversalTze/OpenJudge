# 9. Security & Access Middleware in API Gateway  
**Date:** 2025-05-13
**Status:** Accepted  
**Summary**  
*In the context of* securing and managing access to our services through the API Gateway, *facing* potential security threats, unauthorized access, and performance concerns, *we decided* to implement CORS, CSRF protection, rate limiting, and authentication middleware, *to achieve* a secure, performant, and controlled API request flow.  

**Context**  
- We need to enforce access control and prevent unauthorized cross-origin requests.  
- We must protect against cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.  
- Rate limiting is necessary to prevent abuse and ensure fair resource usage.  
- Authentication middleware is required to validate and authorize requests.  
- A centralized security layer in the API Gateway simplifies access control management.  

**Decision**  
We decided to implement:  
- **CORS middleware** to control which domains can access our APIs and prevent unwanted cross-origin requests.  
- **CSRF protection** to prevent malicious requests from unauthorized sources.  
- **Rate limiting** to restrict excessive requests and prevent abuse.  
- **Authentication middleware** to verify JWTs and manage user authorization at the gateway level.  

**Consequences**  
- Initial setup and fine-tuning are required for each middleware component.  
- Developers need to be aware of CORS restrictions when making requests.  
- Proper configuration of rate limits is essential to balance security and usability.  
- Maintaining authentication mechanisms will require monitoring and periodic updates.
