# 1. Separation of Frontend, Backend, and Worker Logic  
**Date:** 2025-04-13 
**Status:** Accepted  
**Summary**  
*In the context of* building a modular and scalable system, *facing* the need to decouple different concerns for better maintainability and performance, *we decided* to separate frontend, backend, and worker logic into distinct services, *to achieve* a clean architecture with independent scaling, improved development efficiency, and better resource management, *accepting* the complexity of managing inter-service communication.  

**Context**  
- A monolithic structure with tightly coupled frontend, backend, and worker logic can limit scalability and flexibility.  
- We need independent scaling for different components to optimize resource usage.  
- Different teams should be able to work on frontend, backend, and workers separately without dependencies affecting development cycles.  
- Worker processes need to run independently to handle background tasks, such as queue processing, scheduled jobs, and intensive computations.  

**Decision**  
We decided to separate the frontend, backend, and worker logic into distinct services:  
- **Frontend**: Handles user interactions, UI rendering, and communicates with the backend via APIs.  
- **Backend**: Manages business logic, API handling, and database interactions.  
- **Workers**: Perform background processing, async tasks, and scheduled jobs independently.  

**Consequences**  
- Requires additional infrastructure for managing service communication and orchestration.  
- Deployments need to be handled separately for frontend, backend, and workers.  
- Debugging and tracing across multiple services add complexity but improve maintainability.  
- Worker services must be monitored to ensure task execution reliability.
