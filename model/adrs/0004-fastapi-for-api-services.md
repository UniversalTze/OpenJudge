# 4. FastAPI for API Gateway and Problems Service  
**Date:** 2025-04-28
**Status:** Accepted  
**Summary**  
*In the context of* building our API Gateway and Problems service, *facing* the need for a fast, scalable, and easy-to-develop API framework, *we decided* to use FastAPI, *to achieve* high performance, automatic OpenAPI documentation, and seamless integration with our existing infrastructure.  

**Context**  
- We need an API framework that provides high performance and scalability.  
- We require automatic documentation generation to streamline development.  
- We need a framework with strong typing support and async capabilities for efficiency.  
- We aim to integrate easily with Docker and GitHub Actions CI.  

**Decision**  
We decided to use FastAPI due to its asynchronous capabilities, automatic generation of OpenAPI and JSON Schema documentation, and compatibility with Python typing. Its speed and ease of use allow us to improve developer efficiency and maintainability while ensuring high-performance API handling.  

**Consequences**  
- Developers need to familiarize themselves with FastAPIâ€™s framework and async workflows.  
- We need to configure proper containerization with Docker and CI/CD integration.  
- We may need additional middleware for security and authentication.
