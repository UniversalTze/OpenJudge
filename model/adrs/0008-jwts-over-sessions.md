# 8. JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) Over Sessions  
**Date:** 2025-05-13
**Status:** Accepted  
**Summary**  
*In the context of* authentication within a microservices architecture, *facing* the challenge of maintaining session state across multiple services, *we decided* to use JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), *to achieve* a stateless and scalable authentication mechanism without the overhead of centralized session management.  

**Context**  
- Maintaining session state in a microservices environment introduces complexity and performance overhead.  
- We need a scalable authentication mechanism that does not rely on centralized session storage.  
- JWTs allow for stateless authentication, reducing dependency on a shared session store.  
- Tokens can be self-contained, carrying the necessary authentication claims without additional database queries.  

**Decision**  
We decided to implement JWTs for authentication because they provide a stateless approach, reducing the need for session persistence across multiple services. JWTs simplify scaling and integration between services while allowing authentication data to be securely transmitted within signed tokens.  

**Consequences**  
- Proper token expiration and refresh strategies need to be implemented for security.  
- JWT validation must be handled efficiently to prevent unauthorized access.  
- Additional measures, such as token encryption or secure storage of secret keys, are required for security best practices.
