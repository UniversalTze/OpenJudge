# 2. Microservices Architecture Over Monolithic Architecture  
**Date:** 2025-04-25   
**Status:** Accepted  
**Summary**  
*In the context of* building a scalable and maintainable system, *facing* the limitations of a monolithic architecture in terms of scalability, flexibility, and team collaboration, *we decided* to adopt a microservices architecture, *to achieve* independent service deployment, scalability, and improved developer productivity, *accepting* the complexity of managing inter-service communication and infrastructure.  

**Context**  
- A monolithic architecture can become difficult to scale and maintain as the project grows (which is one of our key ASRs).  
- We need flexibility in deploying and updating individual components without impacting the entire system.  
- A distributed team working on different services requires clear separation of concerns and independent development workflows.  
- Microservices allow the use of diverse technology stacks optimized for specific service requirements.  

**Decision**  
We decided to adopt a microservices architecture to enhance scalability, maintainability, and team productivity. Each service operates independently, allowing for faster iteration and deployment while reducing dependencies between modules. This approach aligns with our goals for a cloud-native and efficient development workflow.  

**Consequences**  
- Increased complexity in managing inter-service communication (e.g., API Gateway, service discovery).  
- Requires robust infrastructure for deployment, monitoring, and observability.  
- Potential latency due to network communication between services.  
- Increased operational overhead for handling distributed data consistency and security.
