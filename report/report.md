### Abstract
OpenJudge is a learning-oriented code evaluation platform that prioritizes transparency over the 
traditionally opaque test suites found on most learning platforms like LeetCode. Designed as an 
alternative to those platforms, this system distinguishes itself by providing complete visibility 
of the test cases with detailed feedback mechanisms that enable users to understand their coding 
mistakes rather than receiving cryptic pass/fail notifications. 

The key Architecturally Significant Requirements (ASRs) for this project were: Security, Scalability
and Deployability.
