### Abstract
OpenJudge is a learning-oriented code evaluation platform that prioritizes transparency over the 
traditionally opaque test suites found on most learning platforms like LeetCode. Designed as an 
alternative to those platforms, this system distinguishes itself by providing complete visibility 
of the test cases with detailed feedback mechanisms that enable users to understand their coding 
mistakes rather than receiving cryptic pass/fail notifications. 

The key Architecturally Significant Requirements (ASRs) for this project were: 
- Security (Quality Attribute) - OpenJudge's core feature of executing potentially unsafe or malicious user submitted code leads to significant security risks alongside those already commonly place in web development.
- Scalability (Quality Attribute) - Given our quality attribute, OpenJudge must be designed to handle many concurrent users attempting to browse problems, submit code and connect to the frontend.
- Extensibility (Quality Attribute) - OpenJudge's MVP should be designed to be extensible - both for the addition of new features/services, and to handle more languages that users can solve problems in.
- Deployability (Quality Attribute) - Our quality attribute ensures we need to have a deployable architecture, in particular an automated and simple deployment process.
- Real Time Feedback - test results must be returned to the user in a timely manner without extensive latency.
- Transparent Learning Focused Platform - The initial scope of the project involved having a problem solving platform focused on education and helping the user to solve problems rather than hiding the solution or focusing on competition between users.
